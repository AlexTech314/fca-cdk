**Title:** Mergers & Acquisitions for Middle Markets - Flatirons Capital Advisors

---

## Flatirons Capital Advisors

Flatirons Capital Advisors is a leading mergers and acquisitions advisor to lower middle-market companies.

With decades of transaction advisory experience, our founders identified a growing need in the lower middle-market to bring together a more comprehensive suite of professional resources.

Our buyer relationships are crucial to our ongoing success in making markets for our clients and completing transactions in record time. We are constantly updating our key industry and investment criteria based on the real-time feedback we receive from our vast network of public and private buyers.

The deal process is 100% managed by a senior team member and not pushed down to a junior analyst. This hands-on approach by senior team members ensures a strategic and robust process for our clients.

## Core Values

### Open and Honest Communication
We speak our minds to our clients and demand the same from all others we work with. We insist that bad news travels faster than good news.

### Listen Well, Act Quickly
Every day we strive to listen well, entertain the ideas of others (inside and out), seek counsel, then act decisively.

### Focus
We will tirelessly seek to understand your priorities, never get distracted, and systematically refresh our objectives.

### Accountability
We will deliver on our commitments, be transparent with you about progress and outcomes, and be equally willing to reap the rewards or pay the consequences of our performance.

### Customer Satisfaction
We strive to make you an evangelist by only agreeing to what we can deliver, and always delivering what we agree to.

### Relentlessness
We always inspire ourselves, our co-workers, and our teams to a higher state of performance, speed, quality, completeness, and ultimately competitiveness.

### Respect
We demand ourselves to be professional with every interaction with you, your employees, customers, and vendors. We will treat you with the utmost respect, honesty, directness, and follow-through.

### Extraordinary Teamwork
Every person has a role on our team. We communicate with and count on everyone to play his or her part flawlessly as you would expect them to count on you. When they don't (we are all human), coach and encourage, rather than criticize and lambast.

### Intelligence
We constantly drive creative ideas. We listen for and bring the best ideas and practices to our Company and to you, our client.

### Bold Consistent Vision
We will deliver a compelling, shared vision that passes the elevator test of simplicity and will consistently communicate this to you.
