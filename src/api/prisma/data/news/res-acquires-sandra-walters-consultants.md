RES (Resource Environmental Solutions, LLC) has acquired Sandra Walters Consultants, Inc., one of Florida's premier ecological consulting firms. With this transaction, RES now has more than 70 employees in nine offices across Florida.

Headquartered in the Florida Keys and founded in 1997, Sandra Walters Consultants (SWC) provides a wide range of land use planning, habitat assessment, environmental permitting, and mitigation design services for public and private clients from four offices across southern Florida. SWC has extensive experience developing solutions for the complex land use and water quality issues common in the Florida Keys region, one of the most highly environmentally regulated areas of the country. This background has extended into work on major public infrastructure projects throughout the southern peninsula. SWC also brings to RES an American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) diver safety program, ensuring scientific competence and safety in the marine environment.

"RES has a great reputation for solving complex ecological challenges with creativity and a model that covers the project's long-term performance," says Peter Partlow. Jim Bassett, E Sciences Principal, adds: "When you combine that approach with our local experience, we think it's a winning equation for increasing water quality, flood resiliency, habitat preservation, and climate adaptation across the state."

"We're thrilled to have our team joining RES," says Sandra Walters. "RES brings not just a platform but also the capital to invest to solutions for Florida's complex coastal environments."

"Together, we see a wide range of opportunities for contributing to a healthy environment for Floridians," says Don Seaborn, Region Vice President, East for RES. "From the water quality and algal bloom challenges facing Lake Okeechobee to impaired mangrove and manatee habitats to coastal resiliency needs, we think we have the right model and the right team to deliver durable solutions."
