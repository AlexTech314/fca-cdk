## If you miss the current PREMIUM SELLER'S MARKET, you better hang on for the ride, and a long ride it might be…

It is undeniable we are currently in a Premium Seller's Market. Business owners that are electing to sell all or a portion of their business are realizing some of the highest values in history. Many business owners ask us how much longer it might be until we drop into a neutral (normal) market and then into a much less attractive buyer's market. 2015 M&A activity looks like it will be about 8% above 2014 numbers. According to Intralinks®, this matches 2007's record for M&A activity. Clearly we are in a Premium Seller's Market.

## M&A Market Cycles

If you look back historically (literally to the great depression) you will see like clockwork a Premium Seller's Market every 7 to 10 years. The market peaked in 2000 and then the tech bubble imploded. We saw recovery beginning in 2004, which culminated in the housing bubble in 2007/2008. Presently, we are 8 years into the cycle and at higher M&A levels than the peak of 2007.

How much longer will this Premium Seller's Market last? No one has a crystal ball, but most analysts speculate we will see strong M&A activity through the first half of 2016, with a meaningful slowdown heading into 2017.

## Do I sell when I'm ready or when the market is ready?

This is a very important question for business owners to ask:

- **Premium Seller's Market** – Historically can see 1 – 2 higher EBITDA turns in value
- **Normal Market** – Historically neutral enterprise value
- **Buyer's Market** – Historically up to a 50% discount of a normalized market

If we assume a peak M&A market in 2016 and using history as a guide, we could expect another Premium Seller's Market in 2023/24. That said, 7 years does not appear to be a typical historical market due to the amount of Baby Boomer seller inventory hitting the market.

## The Baby Boomer Factor

There are 8,000 baby boomers retiring each day in the U.S. and 14% are business owners so that's 1,120 business owners a day hitting retirement age. How will that compound over the next 5 to 10 years? It seems clear to many analysts that supply will out-weigh demand which could push the next Premium Seller's Market much further into the future.
