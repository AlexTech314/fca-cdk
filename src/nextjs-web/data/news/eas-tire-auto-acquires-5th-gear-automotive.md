EAS Tire & Auto, a leading automotive repair and service provider in Colorado and a Straightaway brand, is continuing its strategic growth across Colorado with the acquisition of 5th Gear Automotive.

Purchased in 2017 by Eric Gibson and Erika Strauss, 5th Gear Automotive has built a strong reputation for honesty, expert workmanship, and customer-first service. The shop provides full-service vehicle repair and maintenance, operating with ASE-certified technicians and advanced diagnostic technology.

The addition of 5th Gear Automotive marks EAS Tire & Auto's 22nd location in Colorado and a meaningful step in EAS Tire & Auto's expansion efforts. In addition, it strengthens the company's commitment to delivering high-quality service to more communities throughout the state.

"We're incredibly excited to welcome 5th Gear Automotive to the EAS Tire & Auto family," said Bill Vanhoose, brand president of EAS Tire & Auto. "5th Gear Automotive is known for its quality work and loyal customers. We're happy to welcome their talented team into our family and together bring even more value and top-notch service to the Broomfield community for years to come."

"Since taking over 5th Gear Automotive, our mission has been to deliver the kind of service that earns trust, builds relationships, and keeps our community safe on the road," said Erika Strauss, co-owner of 5th Gear Automotive. "When we met the EAS team, it was clear they shared the same philosophy. Their commitment to quality and their investment in people gave us the confidence that our customers and employees will continue to be cared for."
