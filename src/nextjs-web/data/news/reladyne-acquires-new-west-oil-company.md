RelaDyne finishes the year strong by acquiring New West Oil Company, a prominent lubricant and commercial fuels distributor serving customers in Arizona and Southern Nevada.

New West Oil Company ("New West") was founded in 2011 by four industry veterans – Tim Genrich, Ron Reeves, Tom Turley, and Terry Cooney – with a mission to provide customers with exceptional service and quality products at fair prices and a belief that 'Relationships Matter.' By 2013, New West had expanded its services division (New West Environmental) to handle used oil, used coolant, used oil filter pickup, and vacuum services.

"New West Oil has prospered remarkably over the past 9 years and has grown to a company of over 100 employees. This is an incredible milestone for any business and is a testament to the outstanding team we have assembled," said Tim Genrich, CEO of New West Oil Company. "To have the ability to meet our growth goals, we decided to partner with RelaDyne who will provide us and our loyal customers with access to many more products and services that we could never have acquired alone."

New West marks the first acquisition for RelaDyne into the states of Arizona and Nevada.
