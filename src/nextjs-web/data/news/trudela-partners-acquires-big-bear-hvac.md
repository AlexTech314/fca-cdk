Coltala Holdings' HVAC acquisition platform Trudela Partners, a leading provider of residential heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and indoor environmental filtration technology, is pleased to announce the third and fourth additions to their portfolio in just the first quarter of 2020.

With the acquisition of North Texas Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc. in Denton and Frisco-based Big Bear Air Conditioning and Heating, Trudela now serves four counties in the Metroplex with coverage of over 75 percent of the DFW geographic footprint.

Both companies provide quality residential service, installation and replacement, and are strong legacy brands with excellent reputations in the DFW market. With the expansion of territory and technicians, Trudela can provide rapid, world-class service anywhere in Dallas – Fort Worth.

"North Texas and Big Bear afford Trudela strategic access to the growing population in the northern corridor of the Metroplex," remarked Trudela CEO Paul Adams.
