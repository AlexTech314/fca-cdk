UES, a national leading engineering and consulting company, has acquired Biome Consulting Group, an ecological consulting firm located in the Central Gulf Coast region of Florida. Biome conducts a wide variety of applied ecological studies and environmental regulatory compliance-related consulting services throughout the Southeastern U.S. and Caribbean.

Biome's expertise includes consulting on thousands of private development projects, from single family residential through commercial and residential development, as well as government and industrial work. Biome also pioneered the mitigation banking industry in North Florida, which helps to preserve and restore wetlands, natural habitats, and streams so that there is no net loss to the environment during a construction project.

"As advocates for sustainable design, UES is committed to providing environmentally sound solutions that benefit both the communities and clients we serve," said UES CEO Dave Witsken. "Biome's expertise in ecological services will allow us to further advance our goals to better serve our clients."

Biome joins the North Florida region of UES, led by Rick Kushner, P.E. Biome's leadership team will continue to operate the day-to-day business. "The acquisition of Biome further expands our ecological and environmental services of our region, and we are excited to add their expert staff to Team UES," said Kushner, P.E., president of the North Florida region.

One of Biome's founding partners, Glen Miley notes, "We have collaborated with UES professionals for years and have the highest admiration and respect for them. The opportunity to join forces with UES brings us great joy, but also brings to fruition objectives integral to Biome's strategic plan."
