Victory Tire & Auto, a Straightaway Tire & Auto brand, has announced the acquisition of Pod's Complete Car Care, a long-established automotive repair facility in White Bear Lake. The acquisition, finalized on July 9, 2025, marks Victory's 19th shop in the greater Minneapolis region and its first in the White Bear Lake area—further strengthening its footprint across the northeast metro.

The newly acquired location is a well-known, eight-bay shop with the potential to expand to ten bays. With five experienced technicians and two service writers on staff, Victory plans to provide additional resources to support operational growth and continue delivering top-tier customer service.

"Our team at Victory Tire & Auto is very excited to welcome in the great staff from Pod's Complete Car Care," said Jeff Matt, Victory Tire & Auto Brand President. "We were well aware of the excellent reputation this great business has maintained—for decades—in the White Bear Lake area and couldn't be happier to add it to our family of locations! Our guests can expect to see several updates to the property and facility, especially to the customer waiting area."
