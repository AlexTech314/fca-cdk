Align Capital Partners' ("ACP") fire and life safety platform Protegis Fire & Safety ("Protegis" or the "Company") has acquired Tampa-based Florida Fire Service ("Florida Fire"). Florida Fire provides fire alarm, sprinkler, and extinguisher inspection / repair services; along with service and installation. As a result of Protegis' continued growth, the Company now employs nearly 350 fire protection technicians across the country.

Family-owned and operated, Florida Fire has provided a complete line of fire and life safety services to commercial and government properties in Western Florida for over 20 years. "We've had a strategic partnership with Florida Fire for nearly ten years and are pleased to welcome them to our growing Company," said Protegis CEO Mike Epperson.

"We are excited to partner with Protegis as the Company continues to expand in the Southeast. We evaluated several potential partners and due to our existing relationship with Protegis and their trusted reputation in the market, the Company is an excellent fit for our employees and will help facilitate continued high levels of service to our customers," said Florida Fire Founder Doug Higgs.

ACP's initial investment in the Protegis platform came via the acquisition of ISA in 2017 and Florida Fire is Protegis' third add-on acquisition since 2018. "Florida Fire serves as a great anchor for Protegis as we look to expand our footprint in Florida," said ACP Managing Partner Steve Dyke.
