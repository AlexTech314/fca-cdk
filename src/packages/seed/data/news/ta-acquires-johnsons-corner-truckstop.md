TravelCenters of America LLC, operator of the TA and Petro Stopping Centers travel center brands, has acquired the landmark truckstop known as Johnson's Corner, located at I-25, Exit 254, in Johnston, Colorado.

It is rebranding the site to Petro, raising the number of travel centers in the TA and Petro Stopping Centers branded chain to 251.

## History

In 1950, Joe S. Johnson and one of his station managers, Clayton Bearly, staked the outlines of a new Johnson's Corner on the old US Highway 87, which is now I-25. With nothing around but farmland and a view of the Rocky Mountains, Johnson's Corner opened in 1952.

- The iconic Johnson's Corner Restaurant & Bakery (consumers can order its world famous cinnamon rolls online)
- Six diesel lanes
- Fully stocked Travel Store
- A quick-serve deli
- Six showers on a fully automated system
- A drivers lounge
- An UltraONE Rewards Program kiosk and swiping system
- Gasoline at 12 fueling positions
- WiFi, CAT Scale
- 110 truck parking spaces
- ATM, check cashing and TripPak services

The company said that it expects renovations in the coming months to include a Petro:Lube truck service facility.

"We are very happy to have the opportunity to acquire this location--a renowned destination truckstop," said Tom O'Brien, president and CEO of TravelCenters of America. "The addition of Johnson's Corner gives us the opportunity to provide professional drivers a new full-service travel center within our network, while also keeping the charm and character they have come to love at Johnson's Corner."
