Flatirons Capital Advisors, a leading mergers and acquisitions advisor to privately held, middle-market companies, is pleased to announce the merger of Connecticut Electric and ATI Electrical Supply. This merger will create a dynamic electrical supply company serving a wide array of industries and customers. Connecticut Electric is an innovative company committed to product leadership, customer service, and operational excellence, and ATI Electric Supply has been providing the highest quality products.

Greg Knowles, president of ATI Electrical Supply, also announced the merger on the company's LinkedIn page. According to him, "Connecticut Electric products are predominately used in residential homes, apartment complexes, and RV's. The addition of these products to ATI's existing product line expands the offering of both companies to a wider customer base spanning industrial, commercial, and residential customers. I want to thank Onward Capital LLC and Keith Wegen of Flatirons Capital Advisors for their professionalism and faith in ATI. I couldn't have picked better partners to work with. Look for some great new products and services to come as a result."

They are hoping that everyone is as eager as they are to unite these businesses and build on their individual prior successes. At this moment, everything will continue as usual for their clients.
