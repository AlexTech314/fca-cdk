## Excellence is our foundation.

Flatirons Capital Advisors is a leading mergers and acquisitions advisor to privately-held, middle-market companies. With decades of transaction advisory experience and entrepreneurship, our founders identified a growing need in the middle-market business community to bring together a more comprehensive suite of professional resources that combines transaction expertise with the transformational power of experienced business advisory professionals. The deal process is 100% managed by a senior team member and not pushed down to a junior analyst. This hands-on approach by senior team members ensures a strategic and robust process for our clients.
